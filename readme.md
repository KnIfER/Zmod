**A personal modification of open-3d-viewer.**  
Only for learning purpose, because everything belongs to [Zygote Media](https://www.zygotebody.com/), not to me.   
Only contains the free and open-sourced part of open-3d-viewer, no other paid cool stuffs.  
Human models are removed. They are fancy, but large for this repo.   

MOD:  
-Use original shaders.  
-Enable mobile label move.  
-Correct label positioning.  
-Camera nearlimit > 0.  
-Logo without white background.  
-No selection by mouse-right-click.  
-No system context menu by mouse-right-click during navigation.  
  
-Won't hide label on click.  
-Won't reset viewport after dissmissing label.  
  
-Entitiy box-focus only toggable by box icon.  
-Selectable label texts.  

-When you've selected something, short click-and-move won't cause flicker now.  
-Good transient for entity-selection.
